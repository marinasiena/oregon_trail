So - I did all the console stuff and was working on adding it all to a UI but just ran out of time.  It's starting to make a little better sense.  Once I can merget the js with the css/html, it becomes much clearer.  Classes have really helped cut down on the syntax errors every five seconds.  I'd have the logic correct and I would know what I wanted from js, but I would make typos or worse couldn't call things by the proper names so I'd be dead in the water and then question myself...  patience.
